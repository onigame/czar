<DT><B>... get the grey butons to stop saying "WhoRU?"</B></DT>
<DD>
  In the upper-left corner, under "Czar", there's a box where you can tell Czar who you are.
  Every time you reload the page, you'll have to answer this question again.  Sorry about that.
  You shouldn't need to reload the page most of the time; the data automatically refreshes.
  (Also, when new puzzles arrive, the button will say "WhoRU?" until you change the contents
  of that drop-down box.  This is a bug, but we left it in, either because we didn't have time
  to fix it or because we didn't want y'all to jump on the new puzzles.)
</DD>
<DT><B>... get a list of unsolved puzzles?</B></DT>
<DD>
  In the "Filter by tags" section, make sure "solved" and "invert" are checked, and no
  other boxes are.
</DD>
<DT><B>... see who is working on a puzzle?</B></DT>
<DD>
  "(3p)" next to the button means that 3 people are working on it ("3" is just an 
  example, this could be any number).  Hover your mouse over it to see who those people
  are.
</DD>
<DT><B>... work on a new puzzle? ("new" as in it wasn't the last puzzle I was doing.)</B></DT>
<DD>
  First you need to deal with the last puzzle that you were working on (one of the three
  cases below).  Then, click on the light-grey button that says "Do This" on the right 
  side of a puzzle.  You'll be telling Czar that you're working on this puzzle, and leaving whatever
  puzzle you were looking at.  Make sure you are communicating with the people who
  are already working on the puzzle.
</DD>
<DT><B>... indicate that I've solved a puzzle?</B></DT>
<DD>
  Put the solution (if there is one) in the comment field, add your name(s) to it (so we can
  come by and ask you how it worked if we need info for a meta), and add the "solved" tag to the
  tags field.  Then you can move on to a new puzzle!
</DD>
<DT><B>... leave a puzzle that I've made no progress on to work on a new puzzle?</B></DT>
<DD>
  Don't forget that "could not solve" is not the same as "no progress" -- if you've tried
  things and didn't work, that's progress, and you should note it (see below).  But if you
  really didn't do anything, just go to a new puzzle.
</DD>
<DT><B>... leave a puzzle that I *have* made progress on to work on a new puzzle?</B></DT>
<DD>
  Czar keeps track of when people clicked on "Do This", but has no idea who has made
  progress.  If you've made progress on a puzzle but haven't solved it, make sure you put your
  name in the puzzle status area (between "sheet" and the tags) so other people
  picking it up can ask what you've done.  Something like "David can explain this."
  Then click on "Do This" next to the new puzzle.  Don't just jump to a new puzzle
  without leaving a clean trail for us to follow, that's scummy.
</DD>
<DT><B>... "update my status" when I'm still on the same puzzle?</B></DT>
<DD>
  Click on the green button next to your current puzzle (which displays how long since
  you last clicked on it).  This helps us know that you haven't fallen asleep or disappeared
  without telling anybody.
</DD>
<DT><B>... see who has worked on a puzzle in the past?</B></DT>
<DD>
  You can see this on the "who's doing what" page.  Note that we don't distinguish
  between people who spent a long time on a puzzle and people who briefly looked at
  it and moved on.  So please update the status box if you have real progress, or
  at least looked at it for a while and confirmed certain things didn't work.
</DD>
<DT><B>... deal with the issue that I have a bunch of progress on a puzzle but I can't
  write it down for whatever reason but I really need to stop working on it for a while
  and I promise I'll come back to it and I know this is working on more than one puzzle
  at a time but it's for a good cause please please please?</B></DT>
<DD>
  Sigh.  You can't do this in czar, but it is possible to denote this on the 
  "Who's doing what" page.  It's an advanced option, you'll have to figure out how to
  do it yourself or ask the Meta Czar.
